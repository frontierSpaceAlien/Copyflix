# Copyflix
Practice project using React to recreate the Netflix website. Uses API provided by https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get movie titles, images and descriptions.

[WIP Demo here](https://frontierspacealien.github.io/CopyflixSite/)<br>
FIREFOX CAN CORRUPT IMAGES WHICH IS THE ONLY BROWSER TO DO SO.
Some movie images aren't showing due to missing backdrop images from TheMovieDB.
