# Copyflix
Practice project using React to recreate the Netflix website. Uses API provided by https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get movie titles, images and descriptions.

[WIP Demo here](https://frontierspacealien.github.io/CopyflixSite/) Takes couple seconds to load.<br>
Some movie images aren't showing due to missing backdrop images from TheMovieDB.
