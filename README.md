It pulls every trailer belonging to that piece of media and it can be played within the page.

### Interactive Netflix-like Slider 

The sliders were created using React Slick and I then heavily modified React Slick to accurately reflect Netflix's slider.

## Current Problem(s)
Firefox can corrupt images which is the only browser to do so. <br/>
Some movie images aren't showing due to missing backdrop images from TheMovieDB.
